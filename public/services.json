                "description": "The motor oil in your vehicle’s engine serves a whole slew of functions: it lubricates the moving parts, helps act as a sealant against debris, cools the engine, reduces wear and tear, and helps prevent engine corrosion. Keeping it clean is vital for good engine health. Depending on your car and what kind of oil you’re using, you may need to change both the oil & oil filter as much as every 6 months or 10,000 kilometres. Many newer vehicles’ owners’ manuals will recommend changing your oil less frequently – often in-between 8,000 and 16,000 kilometres. Check your vehicle owner’s manual and consult with a professional to be certain what is appropriate for your vehicle.",

                "description": "Every month, or every few petrol fill-ups and especially before any long road trips, it’s a good idea to get under the hood of your car and inspect both the oil and coolant levels while the engine is cool. Low levels of either can lead to engine problems if left unchecked. Refer to your owner’s manual to locate both on your specific vehicle.",
